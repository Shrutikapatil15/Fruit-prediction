🍎🥭🍊 Fruit Prediction on Seed (ML + ANN + AI Models)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the type of fruit (Apple, Mango, Orange, etc.) from images of their seeds using Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and other AI-based models.

The aim is to build an automated classification system that leverages image processing, feature extraction, and supervised learning algorithms to accurately identify fruit categories based on seed characteristics.

🚀 Features

📷 Seed Image Preprocessing – Grayscale conversion, noise removal, edge detection.

🧮 Feature Extraction – Color histograms, texture features, shape descriptors.

🤖 Machine Learning Models – Random Forest, SVM, k-NN for classification.

🧠 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) – Deep learning-based seed classification.

📊 Performance Comparison – Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of ML vs ANN models.

🖼️ Custom Dataset – Apple, Mango, and Orange seed images used for training/testing.
